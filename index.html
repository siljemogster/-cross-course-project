  <h1>Hello world!</h1>  
  <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <p id="web-security-questions">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
  <p id="web-security-answer">Many web threats and attacks occur when a user unknowingly clicks a malicious link, passing on their sensitive information to an untrustworthy source. The result of this could be identity or financial fraud. My best advice to you would be careful with clicking on links you do not know the sender. 

    Especially you need to be careful of links and form data, and to never give away your personal or bank details to any website you do not know. Be careful and never click on links being sent to your email or any social media like Facebook or Instagram. 
    
    In addition, here are some more solutions we can do to protect your website from against web threats and attacks: 
    
    - Sanitization of data: This can be done manually or by using a well-known third-party solution such as for example NodeJS. 
    
    - Secure authorization and authentication: This can be best achieved by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin or Okta. 
    
    - Implementation of automatic user timeout: This would be done by the backend team by setting a session for the expiration of the user credentials.
